    <h2>
        What makes this position appealing?
    </h2>

    <p>
        This is a full-time web software development position for an IT consulting business in Melbourne. Being an IT consulting firm, as a staff member here I would be assigned to projects to build/test/implement web software for clients using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
        <br>
        This position seems appealing to me because at the moment I am very interested in programming and software development, and while I don’t currently have a great knowledge of JavaScript, web development does seem very interesting to me. In addition to this, the pay ($110,000+) and working hours (full time/8-hour shifts) is the type of thing that I’m looking for. While not listed on the advertisement page, I can only assume that this job would have at least some options for travel as it is a firm where you are assigned to projects from external clients which is absolutely something I would be looking for in an ideal job.

    </p>

    <h2>
        Skills, qualifications and experience required for this position
    </h2>

    <p>
        Being a web programming position, this job requires knowledge of and experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and all their sub-components. Listed is also a requirement for experience in full stack web development, i.e. both website and server development. The position also lists “the ability to work in an agile environment” as a requirement for a successful candidate and as such you would need good teamwork skills and likely experience using GitHub or similar software.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Skills, qualification and experience I currently have
    </h2>

    <p>
        At the moment, I am not extremely skilled in programming although I do have some basic knowledge. I am familiar with both Python and AutoHotkey (a hotkey creating language) which have introduced me to the fundamentals of logic gates and some general syntaxing. I have some experience with GitHub and executing projects on GitHub with others and am very well versed in working with a team.
    </p>

    <h2>
        How to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position
    </h2>

    <p class="lastparagraph">
        I will hopefully gain a better understanding of both HTML and CSS throughout this subject as well as other university courses and JavaScript I intend to learn in the Web Programming subject in 2023 and possibly other subjects. If I still don’t feel entirely comfortable with these languages after this, there is a very wide variety of resources available online for them that will be helpful in furthering my knowledge. Although I am not sure if any of the Bachelor of IT subjects cover full stack web development or server development, if by the end of the degree I am still unsure about it, there are plenty of courses on this type of thing online. However, I will take the Further Web Programming subject later on in my degree to give me the most information possible. As for GitHub, my skills will assuredly grow through this degree along with any other projects I complete along the way as it is standard for most software development projects.
