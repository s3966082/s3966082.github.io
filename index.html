    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <h6>ID: 3966082, Email: s3966082@student.rmit.edu.au</h6>

    <p>
        My name is Georgie, I’m 20 years old and I am a first-year student in the Bachelor of IT. I did two years of a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in History, at the University of Melbourne before moving to RMIT but felt I had no career opportunities in the field. In my free time I enjoy playing netball and playing video games. I enjoy PC games like Valorant and Portal as well as Nintendo games like Breath of the Wild and Mario games. I live in a big household of seven people, with my three siblings, two parents and one-year-old nephew. I have one pet at home, a 2-year-old tabby cat, her name is Ash, named after the main character of the Pokémon anime series.

    <h2>
        Interest in IT
    </h2>

    <p>
        The moment I started to become interested in IT, that I can pin-point, would be in mid-2020, when I, bored of lockdown, decided to purchase a Nintendo Switch as I wanted to rekindle my love of Mario games. I started to become interested in gaming again and then met more and more people through this interest in Nintendo games. It was these people that convinced me that I should build my own PC and after watching many, many Linus Tech Tips videos I finally did. That began my interest in PC hardware and PC gaming but I also, through this new community, found a love of programming as well. One of my friends introduced me to a programming language called Auto Hotkey, which basically helped me be even lazier on my computer because of all these hotkeys I was making to automate very simple tasks such as opening a new browser window on my other monitor or replying to a discord message with the push of a button. Because of this interest, I also decided to take an Introduction to Computing class in my last semester at the University of Melbourne in which I learnt the basics of Python.

    <h2>
        Why RMIT?
    </h2>

    <p>
        With all this interest building in the IT field, I finally decided to take the leap and enrol into this course, the Bachelor of IT. The great amount of career prospects that come from this degree was very exciting to me after being in a degree where essentially your only options were teaching or further study. Of course, the financial benefits of these IT career prospects were very persuading as well. I chose RMIT not only because of its reputation as a great institution for this field of study, but because the course, compared to the equivalents at other universities, seemed the most appealing to me. There are always going to be some dull subjects in university courses but most of the subjects listed for this degree seemed at least somewhat interesting to me and made me eager to start the course. Being from the west side of Melbourne and having only a small number of universities within a reasonable distance from where I live, location also played a part in choosing RMIT.

    <h2>
        What do I expect to learn during my studies?
    </h2>

    <p>
        During my time in this course, I expect to learn the general skills required for many IT careers. I understand that obviously there is no way to teach everything one would need for any IT job. However, as someone who has little to no idea what specific field they want to pursue, I am very much looking forward to dabbling in several different sectors of the IT industry. I’ve also come to this degree to learn which parts of IT I enjoy the most and which parts I don’t so much. Group work within an IT context is also something I’m excited, though slightly nervous, to learn in this degree. Although I have plenty of experience working in groups from high school and other activities, it will be interesting to see how that workflow translates in an IT setting. For example, learning how to use GitHub to stay on top of group work, which although I’ve looked into it a little, I am very eager to learn how to use it properly and efficiently as it is a very confusing program to use as a beginner with no instruction.
