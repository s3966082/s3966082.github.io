    <h2>
        What do the results mean to me?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Both the Myers-Briggs and Enneagram personality tests labelled me as an introverted, observant, thinker type who likes to spend time deepening their understanding of the world. And while this does sound like me, the results of these tests mean very little for me as humans are more complex than just 9 or 16 personality types. I am an observant, thinker type, but at times I am also the outgoing, debater type. I have taken the Myers-Briggs test once a year for the last few years and I have gotten everything from ISTJ to ENTP, and of course people change over the years, but the results of these tests usually just reflect my mood and self-perception at the time I take the test. The learning styles test especially means very little for me. It has been proven that distinct learning styles for individuals don’t really exist, everyone learns through many different methods. (Husmann and O'Loughlin, 2018) Nevermind the fact that most of the questions on the learning style test were very general and had little to do with actual learning, (for example: what would you rather do with your friends? See a movie, go to a concert, or go to an amusement park?) I would hardly say that I retain information better when it is presented auditorily more so than visual or kinetic. So all-in-all, these results mean little to me.

    <h2>
        How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
    </h2>

    <p>
        As aforementioned, I don’t feel these results accurately represent my spectrum of personality. The way that I feel when I wake up in the morning is most likely to influence my behaviour in a team. If I wake up feeling energetic and personable, then I’ll likely take a bit more charge in a team, whereas if I’m feeling the opposite, I’m more likely to sit back and observe. My behaviour in a team is also influenced by what kind of basis I’m on with my team members, am I good friends with them? Do I hardly know them? Is this our first meeting? I’m a different type of person depending on all types of environmental factors. The results of the learning style test also have slim chances of affecting my behaviour in a team environment. Even if learning styles did exist, I would not agree with how that test placed me and as such it wouldn’t affect my behaviour.

    <h2>
        How should I take this into account when forming a team?
    </h2>

    <p class="lastparagraph">
        I really don’t feel like I need to consider these results when forming a team. In my opinion, the best way to form a functional team is to just assess the energy in-person through conversing and socialising. It’s generally easier to tell if a team is going to be productive by talking to one another than forming groups based on arbitrary personality types and learning styles assessed by a general 20-question multiple choice quiz. What I’ll be taking into account when forming a team is who I have the most cohesion with and who has similar project ideas or ideas that are interesting to me.
